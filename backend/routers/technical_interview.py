DOMAIN_QUESTION_BANK = {
  'CSE': {
    'Frontend (React)': [
      { 
        "question": 'Explain the Virtual DOM and how it improves performance.', 
        "expected": "Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React updates VDOM first, diffs it with previous VDOM (reconciliation), and strictly updates only changed elements in real DOM, minimizing expensive reflows/repaints." 
      },
      { 
        "question": 'What are React Hooks? Explain useState and useEffect.', 
        "expected": "Hooks allow function components to use state and lifecycle features. useState allows managing local state. useEffect handles side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, duplicating componentDidMount/Update/Unmount." 
      },
      { 
        "question": 'How do you handle state management in a large application?', 
        "expected": "Context API for low-frequency updates, Redux/Zustand for complex global state, React Query for server state. Importance of lifting state up and avoiding prop drilling." 
      },
      { 
        "question": 'Explain the difference between props and state.', 
        "expected": "Props are read-only inputs passed from parent to child. State is mutable data managed within the component itself. Props allow configuration, State allows interactivity." 
      },
      { 
        "question": 'How would you optimize a React app that is rendering slowly?', 
        "expected": "Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, useMemo/useCallback to cache expensive calculations/functions, code splitting with React.lazy, windowing for long lists, analyze with Profiler." 
      }
    ],
    'Backend (Node.js)': [
      { "question": 'Explain the Event Loop in Node.js.', "expected": "Single-threaded loop that offloads blocking I/O to system kernel. Phases: Timers, Pending Callbacks, Poll, Check, Close Callbacks. Uses libuv." },
      { "question": 'How would you handle asynchronous operations in Node.js?', "expected": "Callbacks (legacy), Promises (chaining), and Async/Await (modern, cleaner syntax). Handling errors with try/catch." },
      { "question": 'Design a RESTful API for a user management system.', "expected": "Resources: /users. GET /users (list), GET /users/:id (read), POST /users (create), PUT/PATCH /users/:id (update), DELETE /users/:id. Status codes: 200, 201, 400, 404, 500." },
      { "question": 'What is middleware in Express.js?', "expected": "Functions that access request/response objects. Can modify req/res, end cycle, or call next(). Used for logging, auth, parsing." },
      { "question": 'How do you handle database connections in a serverless environment?', "expected": "Reuse connections (connection pooling) outside function handler to avoid cold start latency and exceeding connection limits (e.g., AWS RDS Proxy)." }
    ],
    'Full Stack': [
      { "question": 'Explain how you would architect a full-stack application from scratch.', "expected": "Frontend (React/Next.js), Backend (Node/Python), DB (SQL/NoSQL). API layer (REST/GraphQL). Auth (JWT/OAuth). CI/CD. Hosting." },
      { "question": 'How do you handle CORS issues?', "expected": "Configure backend to send Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. Use proxy in dev. Understanding Preflight OPTIONS requests." },
      { "question": 'Compare SQL vs NoSQL. When would you use which?', "expected": "SQL (Relational, structured, ACID) for complex queries/transactions. NoSQL (Document/Key-Value, flexible, scalable) for unstructured data/high write throughput." },
      { "question": 'How does authentication work between a frontend and backend?', "expected": "Client sends credentials -> Server verifies & issues Token (JWT) -> Client stores token (HttpOnly Cookie/Storage) -> Client sends token in Header for subsequent requests." },
      { "question": 'Explain the concept of microservices.', "expected": "Architectural style structuring an app as collection of loosely coupled services. Each independently deployable, scalable, owning its own DB. Communicate via API/Events." }
    ]
  },
  'IT': {
    'Network Administration': [
      { "question": 'Explain the OSI model layers.', "expected": "Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application. mnemonic: Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away." },
      { "question": 'What is the difference between TCP and UDP?', "expected": "TCP: Connection-oriented, reliable, ordered, slower (e.g., Web, Email). UDP: Connectionless, unreliable, unordered, faster (e.g., VoIP, Gaming)." },
      { "question": 'How do you troubleshoot a network connectivity issue?', "expected": "Check physical layer (cables), check IP config (ipconfig/ifconfig), ping loopback, ping gateway, ping DNS (8.8.8.8), ping name (google.com) to isolate failure point." }
    ]
  }
}

DEFAULT_QUESTIONS = [
  { "question": 'Tell me about yourself and your technical background.', "expected": "Summary of education, relevant experience, key skills, and passion for the field." },
  { "question": 'Describe a challenging technical problem you solved.', "expected": "STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result. Focus on problem-solving process and outcome." },
  { "question": 'Where do you see yourself in 5 years?', "expected": "Growth mindset, leadership aspirations, staying technical, contributing to company goals." }
